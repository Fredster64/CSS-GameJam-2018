# CSS-GameJam-2018
Dungeon-Crawler with Dynamic Lighting. 

UPDATE: 

The GameJam has now finished. The build we entered can be found in the Unity Project as 'Build 2'. 
The game features dynamic lighting as well as a basic inventory management system and interesting enemy types. It's set in a randomly-generated maze, and the goal is to defeat all of the enemies on a given floor before finding the key which will take you to the next level.
